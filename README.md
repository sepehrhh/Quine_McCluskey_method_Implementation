# Quine_McCluskey_method_Implementation
The Project is an implementation of Quine McCluskey method for minimization of Boolean functions developed in C# programming language.
The code is just an exact implementation of the method step by step https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quine%E2%80%93McCluskey_algorithm.
Solution contains the Program class which gets the boolean function and Function class which goes through the algorithm step by step and the PrimeImplicant class which construct minterms and holds their needed properties.
Will be glad if you push improvements to the code!
